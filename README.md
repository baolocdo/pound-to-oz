Go to `pound-to-oz.js` and implement the function `getOz()`. You should only change the `result` with the correct formula.

Note that `massInLbs` is the function's parameter that will be given by the function caller so there are no concrete values for it. You need to think in abstraction instead of hard-coding any numbers in this function.
